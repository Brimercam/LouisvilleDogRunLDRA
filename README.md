# LouisvilleDogRunLDRA
Overhaul of the existing Louisville Dog Run website, which is need of a serious update (http://www.louisvilledogs.org/).

#Custom CSS
All of the CSS is custom, however these stand out:
1. body, p, and h1- needed to be set w/ a margin: opx;, b/c they created a large margin of space at the 
top of the page which pushed the fixed navigation bar down too much. 
2. #navbar- I created to be fixed w/ a translucent black background, that includes a hover action that changes the link colors.  
3. @media queries- are set to function for cellphones and tablets. Each query resizes all images and text including the navigation bar. 

#Custom JavaScript 
1. initMap- is a custom google map that uses the location of the main headquarters of LDRA.
